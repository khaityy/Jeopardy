# Unit-1-Project
This game is inspired by my want to add pieces of my music into a playable game for the class, and inspired by all the moments I have been slow to answer a question, and all I heard was the “dooo-dooo-dooo-do-do-do-doo-dooo” music in my head. My form of Jeopardy goes by the same rules, five categories having point values ranging from one hundred to five hundred, with an added “2x points” question for each category. Four players will be prompted for at the beginning to get the game to start, and from there we answer 25 questions on various topics such as Hollywood and Live TV mishaps we all heard but might not remember all the way. I hope the class enjoys this as much as I did! Let’s play!
