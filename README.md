This game is inspired by all the moments I have been slow to answer a question, and all I heard was the “dooo-dooo-dooo-do-do-do-doo-dooo” music in my head. My form of Jeopardy goes by the same rules, five categories having point values ranging from one hundred to five hundred. We answer 25 questions on various topics such as Hollywood and Live TV mishaps we all heard but might not remember all the way. I hope the class enjoys this as much as I did! Let’s play!
